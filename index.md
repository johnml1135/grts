# Agentic Coding in 2025 (GitHub Copilot)

**Audience:** coders, software engineers, control engineers, linguists, hobbyists, test techs, interns  
**Audience states:** (1) time-warped from 2023, (2) autocomplete-only + skeptical (“vibe coding”), (3) tried once → wasted time  
**Goal:** retrain habits + provide a safe, repeatable approach to daily agentic workflows, with clear investment in context engineering

**Mantra:** Don’t build features. Build the system that builds features.

## How to use this training
- This is organized as a set of pages (one Markdown file per slide/page).
- Start with Slide 1 and proceed in order.
- Appendices are reference material you can optionally cover during Q&A.

## Timing plan (35 minutes)
- Slide 1 (3 min): Why 2025 is different
- Slide 2 (5 min): What agents are / failure modes
- Slide 3 (7 min): The new job: Context engineering
- Slide 4 (10 min): The workflow flowchart + modes
- Slide 5 (5 min): Stop burning time: anti-patterns → fixes
- Slide 6 (5 min): 2-week training plan + adoption ladder
- Appendix A1–A3: reference material (0–10 min depending on Q&A)
