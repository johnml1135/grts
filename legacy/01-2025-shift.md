# Slide 1 — The 2025 Shift: From “Typing Faster” to “Delegating Work”

**Purpose:** reset expectations; reduce hype; validate skepticism

## Key message
- In 2024, AI helped you write *lines*.
- In 2025, AI can help you move *work*—but only if you learn to manage it like a teammate.

## Where we were (2023–2024)
- Autocomplete + chat: “write this function”, “explain this error”
- Mostly single-file thinking
- Human still did: planning, searching, wiring, testing, refactoring, docs, release notes

## What changed (2025)
- Especially with GPT 5.2, Gemini 3 and Opus 4.5, we are no longer limited by model intelligence, but by proper context engineering.
- “Agentic” workflows: Copilot can help across **multiple files**, propose **plans**, and iterate with **tools** (tests/build/search)
- Value moves from “suggest code” → “assist with the *developer lifecycle*”

## Reassurance for legacy + nonstandard domains (say this out loud)
- This is **not** just for prototypes.
- It’s often *more valuable* in legacy/complex/regulatory work because it forces:
  - explicit constraints
  - repeatable checks
  - documented decisions

## Suggested visual
- **Before/After pipeline graphic**
  - Left: Human does 8 steps, AI does 1 (“autocomplete”)
  - Right: Human does 3 steps (intent/constraints/review), agent does 6 (search/plan/edit/test/summarize)

## Instructor notes (what to emphasize)
- Repeat the mantra: “Don’t build features. Build the system that builds features.”
- Tie it back to this deck: context engineering + oracles + repeatable gates are the “system.”
- Urgency: “You will not be replaced by an agent, but you may be replaced by someone who can direct one well.”
