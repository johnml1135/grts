# Speaker Prep (optional notes)

## Common objections + short responses
- “This is vibe coding, not real engineering.”
  - “Engineering is specs + constraints + verification. Agentic coding forces those—if we do it right.”
  - “Don’t build features. Build the system that builds features.”
- “Our codebase is too weird/legacy/regulated.”
  - “That’s exactly where context engineering + test oracles make the biggest difference.”
- “I tried it and it wasted time.”
  - “Most time waste is missing a plan or missing a test oracle. We’ll use gates to prevent thrash.”

## What to ask the audience (interactive moments)
- “Raise your hand if you’ve only used autocomplete.”
- “What’s one constraint in your domain that a general AI wouldn’t know? (timing budget, safety interlock, blast radius, threat model, data leakage, numerical stability…)”
- “What’s your current oracle: tests, simulator, corpus, golden files, or ‘tribal knowledge’?”
